###### This is a Java project for a Navigation System based on data from OpenStreetMap.

This page includes two different projects:
- The first one, named *Java Project*, is a simple Navigation System on Java
- The second one, named *Java-Prolog project*, is an extension of the above, which also uses more complex information on the streets to make the path-finding more intelligent. For example, instead of trying to minimize the distance between 2 points, an approximation of the speed is used.
